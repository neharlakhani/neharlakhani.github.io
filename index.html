                <h2>Introduction and Background</h2>
                <p>One in five Americans will be diagnosed with skin cancer by the time they turn 70. More than two people die of skin cancer every hour. Unlike other aggressive cancers, skin cancer has a five-year survival rate greater than 95% provided it is detected and treated early. This makes timely and accurate diagnosis the need of the hour.</p> <p>Traditionally, skin lesions are diagnosed manually by visual dermatologist examinations followed by biopsies. Given the growing shortage of dermatologists, automating the diagnostic process would reduce the burden on our medical systems in terms of time, cost and effort, and improve timely accessibility of diagnostic mechanisms to wider segments of society.</p>

            <section id="dataset">
                <h2>Dataset</h2>
                <p>
                  ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP is a collection of around 400,000 images 
                  of isolated skin lesions taken from 3D full body images. Each lesion image is cropped 
                  and labeled to indicate if the lesion is benign or malignant.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The data also includes signiﬁcant metadata, like the patient's age, gender, which can 
                    improve training of the machine learning models. The images resemble regular, close-up 
                    smartphone pictures in order to ensure the quality is representative of the kind of 
                    pictures regularly submitted in telehealth settings.

              <h2>Literature Review</h2>
              <p>
                  Skin cancer detection has signiﬁcantly beneﬁted from the advancements in deep learning 
                  methodologies, offering improved accuracy and eﬃciency compared to traditional 
                  diagnostic approaches. [1] demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs in classifying skin 
                  cancer with accuracy comparable to dermatologists. Their model was trained on over 
                  129,000 clinical images, which shows the scalability of deep learning models. Studies 
                  cited in [2] demonstrated that transfer learning signiﬁcantly enhances the performance 
                  of models when applied to limited datasets. The authors also noted that integrating 
                  deep learning models into clinical workﬂows can aid dermatologists in diagnosing skin 
                  cancer.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  [3] employed ResNet-152 to achieve high accuracy in skin cancer detection. Their 
                  approach demonstrated the eﬃciency of using pre-trained models on large datasets and 
                  ﬁne-tuning them on medical images, showcasing how transfer learning can compensate for 
                  the limited availability of annotated medical data. Researchers at Google Health 
                  presented DermAssist [4], a teledermatology AI system aimed at diagnosing around 26 
                  different skin conditions through deep learning models trained on around 16K data 
                  points collected from telehealth services. They found their system to be non-inferior 
                  in performance in comparison to six dermatologists and clearly superior to six primary 
                  care physicians and six nurse practitioners.

              <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
              <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                  Of the three major types of skin cancer (Basal Cell, Squamous Cell and Melanoma), 
                  Melanoma, while less common, is the deadliest and is estimated to be diagnosed 200,000 
                  times in the US in 2024 with 9000 projected to succumb to it. Skin cancer has a nearly 
                  95% cure rate provided the patient has an early diagnosis and treatment. This makes 
                  diagnosis of skin cancer a time-sensitive problem. Additionally, studies report a 
                  decline in the number of dermatologists available and in the post-covid era, our health 
                  care systems are operating under heavy burdens.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  Accessible diagnostic methods are the need of the hour. Telehealth allows patients who 
                  otherwise lack access to timely diagnosis receive crucial care. The challenge is to 
                  develop an automated system for malignancy prediction in skin lesions using their 
                  images. This system can be used in telehealth settings where users can upload pictures 
                  of lesions to get a preliminary understanding of their skin condition.
              </p>
              <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                  By building an ML model that can classify skin lesion images as cancerous or 
                  non-cancerous, this project aims to:
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  ● Improve detection rates at early stages<br>
                  ● Provide a second opinion for dermatologists to rely on<br>
                  ● Provide access to regions lacking professional diagnostic services
              </p>

                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
                  <h4>Down-sampling Benign Tumors</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the primary concerns with the dataset is the large imbalance between the number 
                        of benign tumors (~400k) and the number of malignant tumors (~400). To address this, we 
                        downsampled the number of benign tumors by randomly sampling using the reservoir 
                        sampling algorithm, ensuring uniform random selection of elements without replacement. 
                        We retained 10k images of benign tumors using this process.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Focused Augmentation of Malignant Tumors</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to improve data variability and address class imbalance by increasing 
                        representation of malignant tumors we did focused augmentation of malignant tumors. We 
                        performed 16 augmentations on each image. The augmentations performed include geometric 
                        transformations like flipping, rotating, distorting as well as color and lighting 
                        modifications including modifying brightness, contrast, saturation, hues, CLAHE. Adding 
                        noise and blurring effects including motion and gaussian blur and gauss noise and 
                        finally simulating occlusions and missing data by cutting out random rectangular 
                        sections from the image.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Image Normalizations</h4>
                    <p>
                        We further normalized values of all pixels to be between 0 and 1 in order to improve 
                        faster convergence, aid optimal weight initialization and promote model stability and 
                        generalization.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Image Resizing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Finally all images were resized to a standard dimension (128x128) to ensure consistency, 
                        reduce computational loads, improve training time and memory efficiency.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Post pre-processing the data, exploratory data analysis was conducted to better 
                        understand the data. This involved calculating image means, deviations, color channels and comparing their distributions across the two target classes.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                    <p>Ground Truth data is hard to come by in medical applications due to privacy concerns. Being able to solve the diagnosis problem with an unsupervised approach would enable significant progress in the area. Thus, despite having ground truth labels, we attempt to find coherent clusters and map available ground truth with the clusters and evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithms in solving the lesion identification problem. We clustered images based on image mean, standard deviations, skewness, RGB channel means and other essential features highlighted in Figure X. We determined through reading and experimentation that the number of clusters in our dataset is around 4. We used this as our k parameter and conducted clustering through K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models. In order to conduct clustering through GMM, we had to ensure feature normality. Two features - image standard deviation and image skew needed further normalization before clustering.
